               <p>The company is sourcing wild herbs mostly from high hilly regions. As a part of social corporate responsibility and to maintain fragile ecological balance, it is offering relatively high price to collectors for sustainability harvested herbs. Similarly, the company has fully or partially supported to establish processing units in different parts of Nepal that helps to create rural employment opportunities. The company has also diversified into domestication of herbs and commercial cultivation to ensure sustainable quality and supply source. In an endeavor to commercialize the farming we have established two nursery for propagation of quality seeds and samplings at Rasuwa and Bara Districts.</p>
